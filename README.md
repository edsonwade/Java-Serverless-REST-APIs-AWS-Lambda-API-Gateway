# üöÄ Java Serverless REST APIs AWS Lambda API Gateway 2024

This repository provides a streamlined guide and code samples for building serverless REST APIs in Java using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model). Dive into the world of serverless architecture with confidence, leveraging AWS Developer Tools for seamless deployment and management.

## üìã Introduction

- [REST API and its design principles](#rest-api-and-its-design-principles): Learn about the principles of designing RESTful APIs, including resource naming, URI structure, HTTP methods, and response codes.

- [Building Serverless REST APIs in AWS with Java](#building-serverless-rest-apis-in-aws-with-java): Explore the process of building serverless REST APIs using Java programming language on the AWS platform. Understand the benefits of serverless architecture and its implementation in AWS.

- [Amazon API Gateway](#amazon-api-gateway): Discover Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

- [Build and deploy API with AWS SAM](#build-and-deploy-api-with-aws-sam): Learn about AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), a framework for building serverless applications and deploying them with ease.

- [AWS Lambda](#aws-lambda): Delve into AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

- [Implement User Sign-up, Sign-in, and Confirmation features](#implement-user-sign-up-sign-in-and-confirmation-features): Implement user authentication features such as sign-up, sign-in, and email confirmation using AWS services like Amazon Cognito.

- [Amazon Cognito](#amazon-cognito): Explore Amazon Cognito, a user authentication and authorization service that helps you manage user identities and secure access to your APIs.

- [Learn to use Cognito Authorizers](#learn-to-use-cognito-authorizers): Understand how to use Cognito Authorizers to control access to your API endpoints based on user authentication status and permissions.

- [Implement custom Lambda Authorizer to validate JWT](#implement-custom-lambda-authorizer-to-validate-jwt): Create custom Lambda Authorizers to validate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and authenticate users before allowing access to API endpoints.

- [Learn to Encrypt & Decrypt sensitive environment variables](#learn-to-encrypt--decrypt-sensitive-environment-variables): Explore techniques for encrypting and decrypting sensitive environment variables used in your serverless applications.

- [Learn to use API Keys and Usage Plans](#learn-to-use-api-keys-and-usage-plans): Understand how to use API Keys and Usage Plans in Amazon API Gateway to control access to your APIs and track usage.

- [Unit Test AWS Lambda functions](#unit-test-aws-lambda-functions): Learn best practices for writing unit tests for AWS Lambda functions to ensure they function correctly in different scenarios.

- [AWS CI/CD](#aws-cicd): Discover AWS CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) practices and tools for automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

- [AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline](#aws-codecommit-aws-codebuild-aws-codepipeline): Explore AWS Developer Tools such as AWS CodeCommit (a fully managed source control service), AWS CodeBuild (a fully managed build service), and AWS CodePipeline (a continuous integration and continuous delivery service) for building CI/CD pipelines and automating software delivery workflows.
